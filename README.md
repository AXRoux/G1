# Next.js Challenges

Welcome to the Next.js Challenges repository! This project is designed to help you improve your skills in building modern web applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and various UI frameworks.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of challenges that focus on implementing best practices, optimizations, and modern web development techniques using the Next.js framework. Each challenge is designed to test and enhance your skills in different aspects of web development.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Shadcn UI
- Radix UI
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Challenges

The challenges in this repository cover various aspects of modern web development, including:

1. Implementing React Server Components (RSC)
2. Optimizing performance with dynamic imports and code splitting
3. Creating responsive designs using Tailwind CSS
4. Building accessible UI components with Shadcn UI and Radix UI
5. Implementing efficient state management and data fetching
6. Handling form validation using Zod
7. Optimizing images and improving Core Web Vitals

Each challenge is implemented within the `components` and `pages` directories. You'll find the main components for each challenge in their respective files.

## Project Structure

- `components/`: Contains reusable React components
- `pages/`: Next.js pages for routing
- `styles/`: Global styles and CSS modules
- `public/`: Static assets
